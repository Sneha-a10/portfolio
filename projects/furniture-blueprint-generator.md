# Furniture Blueprint Generator

## Problem
Furniture design is often manual and time-consuming, limiting rapid prototyping and accessibility for non-designers.

## What I Built
A conditional generative system that produces furniture blueprint images from textual descriptions using a hybrid CVAE architecture with skip connections, including data preprocessing, evaluation of multiple generative architectures, training, and comparative analysis.

## How It Works
The system takes text descriptions as input and uses a hybrid CVAE (Conditional Variational Autoencoder) with skip connections to generate corresponding furniture blueprint images.
